## Implemetations of Machine Learning Algorithms
### This repository is my collection of implementations for various machine learning algorithms.
So far I have implemeted the following algorithms:
<br>
<br>
__Supervised Learning__
<br>
<br>
    - K-nearest neighbors
<br>
    - Linear Regression with exact solution
<br>
    - Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
<br>
    - Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent
<br>
    - Naive Bayes
<br>
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis
<br>
    - Hard Margin SVM by Primal Formulation
<br>
<br>
__Unsupervised Learning__
<br>
<br>
    - DBSCAN
 <br>
    - Spectral Clustering
    
__Unsupervised Learning__
<br>
<br>
    - Dense Network with Activations
 <br>
